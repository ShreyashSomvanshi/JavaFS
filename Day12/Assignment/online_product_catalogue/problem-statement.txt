Problem Statement:
    We are tasked with building a Node.js application that serves as an online product catalog where users
    can view available products and an admin can add new products to the catalog. When a new product is 
    added by the admin, it should immediately be visible to the users on the product list. 
    The application will utilize Node.js, Express.js, and a simple in-memory data store to manage products.

The system should have two main user roles:
    1. User Role:
        View a list of available products.
        See details of each product such as name, description, price, and availability.
    
    2. Admin Role:
        Add new products to the catalog.
        Provide product details (name, description, price).
        When a new product is added, it should be automatically available to users on the catalog.
        has context menu
